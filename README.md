# KYC_vLLM


**KYC_vLLM** (Know Your Customer via Vision and Large Language Models) is a full-stack project designed to perform secure, AI-powered identity verification. It combines facial recognition, document authenticity checks, and OCR-based data matching to help detect fraud and ensure regulatory compliance.

This project was developed in collaboration with **Mr Zakariyya (Effyis)** and contributed by:


- **Naoual El Omri**
- **Aya Rabeh**



## Project Overview

KYC_vLLM offers a modular and scalable pipeline for user verification, including:

### 1. Face Match Verification
- **Goal:** Confirm that the user’s selfie matches the ID card photo.
- **Tech:** `DeepFace` (ArcFace model), OpenCV
- **Frontend:** Streamlit interface (`ui-01`)
- **Backend API:** FastAPI endpoint (`fastapi-01`)

### 2. Fake ID Detection
- **Goal:** Detect counterfeit ID cards using anomaly detection.
- **Tech:** Convolutional Autoencoder trained on real IDs
- **Frontend:** Streamlit (`ui-02`)
- **Backend API:** FastAPI (`fastapi-02`)

### 3. Data Consistency Verification
- **Goal:** Ensure that the information entered by the user (name, CIN, birth date...) matches what is extracted from the ID using OCR.
- **Tech:** EasyOCR + Regex parsing
- **Frontend:** Streamlit (`ui-03`)
- **Backend API:** FastAPI (`fastapi-03`)

# UI-03 – Identity Card Information Verification Interface

This Streamlit interface allows the user to:
- Upload a Moroccan ID card image
- Enter expected info (CIN, full name, date of birth, expiry date)
- Send everything to the `fastapi-03` API
- Compare the extracted vs expected data (MATCH or MISMATCH)



## Endpoint Used

POST http://localhost:8000/verify-card-info



## How to Run


cd ui-03  

python -m venv venv  

venv\Scripts\activate         # On Windows  

pip install -r requirements.txt  

streamlit run app.py  


## Note

Make sure the `fastapi-03` backend is running at:  



uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
